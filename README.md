# SupplyChain2026
Developing a comprehensive supply chain platform for medical logistics is a heavy lift, especially with the added complexity of fleet management (ambulances) and strict approval workflows.

This repository now includes a minimal Python domain implementation for:

- Inventory & Equipment Management
- Ambulance Fleet Integration
- Multi-tier Approval Engine
- Staff & Scheduling
- Automated Stock Taking with auto-reconciliation

## Run tests

```bash
python -m unittest -v
```
